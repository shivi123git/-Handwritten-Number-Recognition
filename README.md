# -Handwritten-Number-Recognition
Developed a machine learning model using a convolutional neural network trained on the MNIST dataset to differentiate handwritten numbers in various styles. Experimented with deep learning, optimized hyperparameters, and improved accuracy through iterative testing.

There may be some errors; this was done solely for research and experimentation.


Learning Feature Extraction: CNNs excel at automatically extracting features from images, which is a key reason for using them. This model helps the machine "learn" to recognize digits by detecting patterns like edges, shapes, and curves.
Practical Use Case: This kind of model is often used in real-world applications for digit recognition, handwriting analysis, or similar tasks. The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark for testing machine learning models.
Deep Learning Practice: This gives you a hands-on experience of building and training deep learning models, specifically CNNs, which are widely used in computer vision tasks.

Why This Approach (CNN with MNIST)?
Convolutional Layers: These layers are designed to automatically learn spatial hierarchies in images, making CNNs much more effective for image classification tasks than traditional feed-forward neural networks.
